# OnlineShopping-Cart-And-Billing-System:
The Organic Food And Co  Project is creating for store the detail of an organic food store documents as Customer Details, User Details, Billing Section, Product Details also purchasedetails, and maintain the billing system of the organic food store. It is easy to use for human being to store and maintain an Billing System And Shopping Cart Details.

The future enhancement of this project is to develop it for the control all process of the Organic food Store, now it is to control only sales and order for food products goods. We cannot use it for sales or order of food accessories. The Organic Food And Co project is helping us to maintain or control all transactions of an organic food Store use by any system or Computer. The actual purpose of the project is to reduce the time to control an organic food store billing system and store records in computer.

The Indian food and grocery retail sector is in a transformation mode for various reasons like strong macro-economic fundamentals and the changing socio-economic scene. These factors are driving what were once traditional and small scale retail outlets into organized retail formats aimed at catering to the evolving tastes and needs of the discerning consumers. Economic development is frequently characterized by greater use of large, multi-line food retail outlets including supermarkets and hypermarkets (Veeck and Veeck, 2000).
Five types of analysis were found in the literature. These could be categorized as under:
 
 
1.	Store Image and Satisfaction in the food and grocery retail environment
 
2.	Nutritional consciousness due to spread of supermarkets
 
3.	Consumer demographics and retail format choice
 
4.	Pricing practices by modern retail
 
Cross shopping and retail format choice 

1.1	Objectives
The Organic Food And Co project is helping us to maintain or control all transactions of an Organic food Store use by any system or Computer. The actual purpose of the project isto reduce the time to control Billing  and system and store records in computer.
1.2 Existing System
The existing system in an Billing And Shopping Cart Store is that when a customer enters the store he needs to go to a sales person to get the product details. In the current project the customer can make use of this application and get the product details of the desired product and add to his cart and he himself can continue for the billing section.

#SYSTEM DESIGN
A Blue Print for the development and analysis of the “Organic Food And Co”.
4.1 System Design
System design provides the understandings and procedural details necessary for implementing the system recommended in the system study. Emphasis is on translating  the performancerequirements into design specifications. The design phase is a transition from a useroriented document (System proposal) to a document oriented to the programmers ordatabase personnel.
System design goes through two phases of development:
• Logical Design
• Physical Design
A data flow diagram shows the logical flow of the system. For a system it describes the input(source), output (destination), database (data stores) and procedures (data flows) all in aformat that meet’s the user’s requirement. When analysis prepares the logical design, theyspecify the user needs at the level of detail that virtually determines the information flow intil an out of the system and the required data resources. The logical design also specifies inputforms and screen layouts.
The activities following logical design are the procedure followed in the physical design e.g.,producing programs, software, file and a working system. Design specifications instruct theuser about what system should do.
Five Objectives of design input focus on:
• Controlling the amount of input required.
• Avoid delay.
• Avoiding errors in data.
• Avoiding extra Steps.
• Keeping the process simple.
 

4.2 Modules of the Project
“Billing System And Shopping Cart ” has in all 2 modules and shall be implemented in phases.The number of phases and the modules will be implemented as follows.
• User Module: Allows the Administrator to access the Application without any limitations.
• Customer Module: Allows the customers to have a look over the application,browse over thevarious categories of products. Buy the products from the application.

#TESTING
5.1 TESTING
The development of software systems involves a series of production activities whereopportunities for injections of human fallibilities are enormous. Errors may begin to occur atvery inception of the process where the objectives, may be erroneously or imperfectly specified, as well as in later design and development stages. Because of human perform and communicate in perfection, software development is accompanied by qualityassurance activity.Software testing is a critical element of software quality assurance and represents the Ultimate review of specification, design and coding. In general, testing starts with test plan.The test plan identifies all testing related activities that need to be performed along with thescheduled and guidelines for testing. The plan also specifies the levels of testing that need tobe done, by identifying the different testing units. Based on the plan, the testing commences.For each unit specified in the plan, first the test cases and reports are produced. Testingpresents an Interesting anomaly for a software engineer.
5.2 Testing is basically classified into
• Blac Box Testing
• White Box Testing
Black Box Testing
Blac box testing focuses in the functional requirements of the software. It enablessoftware engineer to derive sets of inputs conditions that will fully exercise all functionalrequirements for a program.
Black Box testing attempts to find errors in the following categories:
• Incorrect or missing function
• Interface errors
• Errors in data structures or external database access
• Performance errors
• Initialisation and termination error
• Errors in data structures or external database access
• Performance errors
• Initialisation and termination error
• Errors in data structures or external database access
• Performance errors
• Initialisation and termination error
Generally Black Box testing is applied for high level testing such as system testing,acceptance testing.
White Box Testing
White box testing, sometimes called glass box testing is a test case design methodwhich uses the control structure of the procedural design to derive test cases.
White Box Testing is applied to:
• Exercise all logical decision on their true and false sides
• Exercise all loops at their boundaries and within their operational bounds
• Exercise internal data structures to assure their validity.
5.3 Testing Strategies
• Unit Testing
• Integration Testing
• Acceptance Testing
Unit Testing:
Unit testing focuses on the verification effort on the smallest unit of software desig module. Using the detailed design description as a guide, important control parts are tested touncover errors within the boundary of the modules. The relative complexity of tests and theerrors detected as a result is limited by constraint scope established for unit testing. The unitest is always white box oriented, and the step can be conducted in parallel for multiple modules.



Integrated Testing:
With unit testing the modules may function properly, but at time they may haveinadvertent, adverse affect on another; sub function, when combined, may not produce thedesired major function; Individually acceptable impression may be magnified to unacceptablelevel; global data structures may present problems.Integration testing is symmetric technique for constructing the program structurewhile at the same time conducting tests to uncover errorsassociated with interfacing. Theobjective is to take unit tested modules and builds program structure that has been dictatedby the design.
Acceptance Testing:
System under consideration is tested for acceptance by constantly keeping in touchwith the prospective system. Series of acceptance test are conducted to enable the user tovalidate all requirements. Acceptance testing involves planning and execution of
• Functional Test
• Performance Test
• Stress Test
Functional test is the exercising of the code with nominal input values for which the expectedvalues for which the expected values for which the expected values are known.Performance test determines the amount of execution time spent in various parts of the unit,program throughput and response time. This test is productive at the subsystem and system level.
Stress test is designed to intentionally break the unit and the strength and the limitation of theprogram are examined.
